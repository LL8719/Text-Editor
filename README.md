## Description

Text-Editor is a single-page application that meets the Progressive Web App (PWA) criteria, meaning that it can be installed on a device like a native app. The app features data persistence techniques, which allow the user to store their text documents offline or in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The app uses an IndexedDB database and a lightweight wrapper called idb for storing and retrieving data. The app is designed to be accessible offline and still function as expected.
